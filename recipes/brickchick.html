    <h3><strong>Cooking Directions</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>De-bone the chicken, leaving drumstick on wing instaxct. Seperate the drumsticks from the carcass and save them for later use.</li>
            <li>Season the chicken skin side with <em>only</em> salt. Flip the chicken and season the flesh with salt, black pepper, and zest from one lemon about half a lemon per side. Place chicken on plate with skin side up and let sit overnight in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>Preheat Oven to 500°F. Fill saucepan with chicken stock. Place potatoes and drumsticks into saucepan, add rosemary, add bay leaf, and add salt and bring to boil so the potatoes can cook while we make the chicken. </li>
            <li>In the hot stainless steel pan add neutral oil until it reaches smoke point, then add chicken, skin side down. Place the brick wrapped in aluminum foil on top of the chicken. Once the edges start to brown, place the pan in the oven at 500°F for about 20-25 minutes.</li>

            <li>Remove chicken from the oven and place on baking sheet with a wire rack, skin side facing up and allow chicken to rest. <em>Do not remove pan remains, this will become our sauce.</em>.</li>
            <li>Heat up a second pan to medium-high and place the smashed potatoes into the pan, add butter, rosemary, and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat up stainless steel frying pan we cooked the chicken in to medium, add chopped shallots, capers, and butter. Let it cook down but not burn. </li>
            <li>Place rosemary smashed potatoes onto a serving dish, next place the chicken on top of our potatoes, remove drumsticks from chicken stock and place on each side of serving dish, and finally pour the caper-shallot-butter sauce over the chicken and potatoes.</li>
