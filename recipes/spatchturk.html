        <h2><strong>Why does Spatchcocking a Turkey work?</strong></h2>
            <p>Traditional methods of cooking a turket often leaves the breast meat dry by the time the dark meat has finished cooking. This is due to the fact that the breast meat is exposed during the cooking period whereas the dark meat is much more protected. But when Spatchcocking a turkey, the goal is to flatten the bird which allows much more even cooking and much more crispy skin, so we end up with a much more juicy bird.</p>
